   # generation
   --schemas=N           number of schemas to create [5]
   --records=N           number of records per table [100,000,000]
   --repository=S        where the generated data will be 
                         stored    
   --dataset-name=S      how this dataset will be named in the
                         repository       
   --no-binlog           disables writing to binary logs during 
                         creation
   --generation-flow=S   {serial,parallel} Defines whether the
                         schemas are created one at the time (serial)
                         or all together (parallel)
   --generation-method=S {clone-first,generate-all}
                         With 'clone-first', one database is created
                         and then copied N times.
                         With 'generate-all', every database is created
                         independently

   # management
   --load=from_path:to_path  
                    replaces the data directory 'to_path' with the 
                    data directory 'from_path'   
                    from_path and to_path can be remote addresses in
                    the form hostname:/path/to/repository
   --skip-logs      do not copy innodb log files
   --mysql-init=S   path to the mysql init script [/etc/init.d/mysqld]
